This repository provides my internship at Laboratoire Dieudonné of Univeristy of Nice, under the supervision of Pr François Delarue. The subject is "Modeling Volatility with Fractional Brownian Motion". 

Matching volatility dynamics, term structure, and stylized
facts such as long memory presents a modeling challenge. Modeling
volatility in high-frequency data is particularly complex
due to the specific market microstructure. Traditional stochastic
volatility models are based on standard Brownian motion.
In the groundbreaking article Volatility is Rough [10], the authors
propose a model for high-frequency data volatility using
stochastic processes driven by noisier signals than standard
Brownian motion, specifically fractional Brownian motion with
a Hurst parameter H < 1/2. This thesis firstly explores the
mathematics of fractional Brownian motion and investigates
Rough Paths integration through the Young’s integral. The objective
is, secondly, to develop the ability to simulate, test, and
critically evaluate the model presented in the aforementioned
article, the Rough Fractional Stochastic Volatility model.
