# Internship at LJAD, University of Nice  
### **Subject:** Modeling Volatility with Fractional Brownian Motion

This repository contains my work during the internship at **Laboratoire Dieudonné, University of Nice**, under the supervision of **Prof. François Delarue**. The subject of the research is _"Modeling Volatility with Fractional Brownian Motion"_. The project explores mathematical challenges in constructing a stochastic integral with respect to fractional Brownian motion, proposes an algorithm to efficiently generate trajectories of fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, and provides a numerical analysis on high-frequency trading data.

### **Abstract**

*Matching volatility dynamics, term structure, and stylized facts such as long memory presents a modeling challenge. Modeling volatility in high-frequency data is particularly complex due to the specific market microstructure. Traditional stochastic volatility models are based on standard Brownian motion.*

*In the groundbreaking article "Volatility is Rough" [10], the authors propose a model for high-frequency data volatility using stochastic processes driven by noisier signals than standard Brownian motion, specifically fractional Brownian motion with a Hurst parameter \( H < \frac{1}{2} \).*

*This thesis first explores the mathematics of fractional Brownian motion and investigates Rough Paths integration through the Young’s integral. The objective is, secondly, to develop the ability to simulate, test, and critically evaluate the model presented in the aforementioned article—the Rough Fractional Stochastic Volatility model.*
